Why increase the use of alcoholic beverages in Russia?
It's no secret that the production of alcohol and alcoholic beverages brings considerable profit companies. Gains from the sale of alcoholic beverages are less than from the drug trade, weapons and drugs. Therefore, companies in every way impose stereotypes that praise alcohol consumption. Private profit for them - above all!
Consequently, to defeat alcoholism as a nation-wide disaster, need to make the existing system of social relations more equitable and humane.
Temperance societies will solve almost impossible task: how to overcome resistance of the government, which not supporting sobriety, this foundation of state power, but companies producing alcoholic beverages, although filling state coffers with money, but leading the country to ruin.

In ancient Rome, the Gauls was approaching the Capitoline temple, the last bastion of Rome.
Geese have spotted them and cried out, waking custody that fell asleep. The custody repulsed attack, so the geese saved Rome. Could the Whether the Temperance Societies’ wake custody of our government?
Russian ethnic personality type has excessive emotionality and difficult switching from one activity to another. Farming in the harsh environment has formed a Russian's ability to a tremendous effort. However, the lack of time did not allow him to develop a pronounced habit of thoroughness, accuracy in work.
The employee could not work seamlessly every day for a year - he worked intermittently. So field work must be performed in a short time due to climatic conditions. Saying "either on the chest crosses, or head in the bushes» demonstrate that moderate middle is not a major in traditional Russian values, among which often lacked respect for money, ability to correlate spend with income.
 Russian man has unconditional meekness to all circumstance, indifference to all the inconveniences and misfortune or failure in life. He differs outstanding shrewdness, often expressed in the hardest, and critical moments of life surprising resourcefulness, but in their actions rely on luck.
 The flip side of patience and humility was the use of alcohol - drink to the bottom, without worrying about snack. In Russia, the most common drinks from antiquity were kvass and beer, intoxicating drink made from honey.

Graph (HFA-DB) shows the consumption of alcohol in Russia and the USSR from 1900 to 2010 per person. Liter of absolute alcohol - it's a liter of 100% alcohol. In 1905, in tsarist Russia consumed 3.5 liters per capita per year. In 1940, - 1.9 liters per capita per year. After beginning the Great Patriotic War, in August 1941, soldiers and commanders of the army in the front line were given any day to 100 grams of forty-degree vodka.
 In the postwar years, people began to consume less vodka and buy more confectionery and consumer goods. “Postwar Soviet Union drank moderately: just 1.85 liters of alcohol per capita in 1948 - 1950. In the Soviet Union era "developed socialism" alcohol consumption grew rapidly: in 1960 it was 3.9 liters of alcohol, and in 1970 - already 6.8 liters.
 From 1940 to 1979 the population increased by 35% and the production of alcoholic beverages increased by 740%, and that is outstripping population growth of more than 20 times, exceeding the world average consumption of about 2.5 times! As a result, alcohol consumption in 1980 reached 8.7 per capita, and in 1984 - already 10.5 liters per person per year. (4, p 123)”

In his last years of Brezhnev alcohol consumption in the USSR has increased more than ten-fold compared to the way it was before the death of Stalin, 40 million people, or one-sixth of the total population of the country, constantly boozing.” Consequences of alcoholism were the deaths of 1million of citizens each year, 85 % increase in crime offenses committed while intoxicated, 16,5 % of the infants had signs of mental retardation. (4, p 123)” 
After the death of Stalin, the Russian people had no leaders capable of leading it to national revival, and those who were in power were far from expressing the interests of the Russian state construction. Speculation has become the norm of the state apparatus.

If in the 40s the country lacked the technical means and hard work, diligence, good faith was even in excess, in the 70s, on the contrary, the main deficiency of culture has become a bona fide, independent, proactive work. It is this shortage has caused all other kinds of deficits in our country. Rate of return of labor potential, increases in the second half of the 40-50s, 60 - 70 years began to decline. 
In the 60-70s dominate forms of work organization based on administrative bans, petty regulations, and various constraints upon independence, initiative and enterprise of Russian worker. Bureaucratic control system required obedient executor, entrepreneurship, independence regarded as inconvenient human quality.

Economy was not able to ensure the growth of goods and services that could decrease alcohol consumption. Not all were able and willing to save up money, in economic deficit, was an importance not money, but the way of access to material goods. The equalization of wages, the growing alienation of man from real participation in economic and political life supported binge drinking. 
An even worse situation existed in the village, outflow of the most qualified and energetic people in the city, the lack of prospects, the loss of value orientation led to what is already in the 60s village began to drink more of the city. “According to the census of 1959 in Russia were more than 294 thousand rural settlements. And in 1989 - 156 000, i.e. 138 thousand ruined villages. Compare: in the Great Patriotic War destroyed 70,000 villages. (1, p103)”
Teenagers have seen in the tradition of drinking an important means of socialization, inclusion into adulthood, way to win credibility. As a result, 59% of them continued to abuse probably did not imagine the opportunity to live differently. In the context of the eternal and permanent deficit limits - in housing, work, creativity - drinking compensation became uncomfortable life. 
 
Heavy drinking was not just a rite replacing natural rest; it turned into a stereotype of behavior, where the usual is no longer the only "habitual drunkenness", but also the use of spirits at work. In Soviet society, the booze was important to identify with the environment, inclusion in the tradition as a way of obtaining recognition from colleagues and comrades, and finally for approval famous democracy, for the table is all equal. Finally, the total deficit remained bottle is not subject to any fluctuations "currency" at the informal market transactions "you - I, I - you."

A lie appears in the press that you may drink cultural, moderately. Alcoholics are to blame. But make terrible social problem ridiculous - it means to make it not dangerous. Story about cultural use drug is simply to provoke our children, who never in his life did not try, so they tried it, and it sucked into drunkenness. 
May 16, 1985 the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR issued a decree "On strengthening the struggle against drunkenness and alcoholism." Academician Fyodor Uglov headed in 1988 Union struggle for people's sobriety. 
 Alcohol consumption fell to 11.5 liters per person per year. First time in many years, the death rate began to decline, and life expectancy - to grow. By 1987, life expectancy for men increased by 3.2 years. 
At the same time revealed the horrifying picture almost biological need for a significant part of the nation in alcohol: all over the country there were huge queues for which became deficit vodka, sugar, yeast. Moonshine intensified. The budget deficit has grown. Money began to go to the alcohol mafia emerged.
All attempts to drastically change the tradition of drinking alcoholic beverages always turn around quality deterioration. We fail to eradicate traditions. We need to adjust the tradition. Futility bans on alcohol evident. It is about lifestyle, certain stereotypes of behavior. We can’t stop them, but we can gradually change. 
 Russia ranked fourth in the world in the consumption of alcohol in 2013. According to the World Health Association per capita in Russia accounted for 15,7  liters of pure alcohol per year, which is approximately 2.5 times higher than the world average, and over the past ten years this figure has not changed.
As an alternative to follow the example of the Scandinavian countries - start strict regulation of the alcohol market. The most effective way to fight - is to reduce the availability of alcohol (achieved a certain set of methods). In particular, it is necessary to raise the price of alcohol, which makes it less accessible to citizens. And so it should be time limit alcohol sales, sell it only in specialty stores.
We need to have anti-alcohol programs among children and youth in Sunday schools and educational institutions. We must learn telling detail about the nature of alcoholism and drunkenness, the dire consequences of personal destruction due to alcohol abuse. We must know citing statistics that can’t leave anyone indifferent. 
Excessive alcohol consumption in Russia - is not a disease, and the index of acute social tension. To reduce the level of alcohol consumption in our country needs a whole range of government programs aimed at introducing a sober way of life. Excessive use of alcohol can ruin a population our nation!
